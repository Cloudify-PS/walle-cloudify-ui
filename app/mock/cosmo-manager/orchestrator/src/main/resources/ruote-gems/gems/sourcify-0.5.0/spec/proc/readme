Since Proc#to_source depends on Proc#to_sexp, getting Proc#to_source correct
implies the correctness of Proc#to_sexp, thus, there is no need to maintain
2 sets of almost similar specs ... the only spec worth maintaining separately
is the one for variables, since we are concerned with whether the correct
representation of sexp is there.
