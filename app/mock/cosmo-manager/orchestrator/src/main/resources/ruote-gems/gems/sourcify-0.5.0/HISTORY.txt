=== 0.5.0 (May 2, 2011)

* adds Proc#to_raw_source that supports extracting of raw code, as it is written in
  the source code (see issue#9), it supports all options that are already supported
  by Proc#to_source.
* MRI-1.8.6 now supports both ParseTree & static-scanner mode
* out with infinity_test (due to unresolvable & unexpected consistent failure in
  running specs for jruby-1.6.1 & always running ParseTree mode specs in static-scanner
  mode), use homebaked rake tasks (spec:parsetree, spec:static & spec:all) to acheive
  testing of different rubies in different modes
* removd dependency on jeweler, & use bundler instead to handle dependency & also have
  our own handcrafted gemspec file

=== 0.4.2 (Feb 06, 2011)

* fixes Sourcify::NoMatchingProcError when inline proc contains hashes (issue#7) [#ngty]
* uses RubyParser#parse to eval correctness of code instead of Kernel#eval [#ngty]

=== 0.4.1 (Jan 29, 2011)

* fixes Sourcify::NoMatchingProcError when if/unless/until/while modifier follows
  a trailing backslash (see issue#5) [#ngty]

=== 0.4.0 (Oct 15, 2010)

* adds Proc#to_source(:strip_enclosure => ...) (& the Proc#to_sexp equivalent) to ease
  stripping of enclosing 'proc {|params| ... }', returning only the inner code body
  '...' [#ngty]
* adds Proc#to_source(:attached_to => ..., :ignore_nested => ..., &body_matcher) (& the
  Proc#to_sexp equivalent) to narrow down code scanning, avoiding unnecessary
  Sourcify::MultipleMatchingProcsPerLineError, useful for libs that can anticipate
  how the proc should look like [#ngty]
* adds support for running in MRI-1.9.2 [#ngty]
* fixes '/' operator always treated as start of regexp [#ngty & #seamusabshere]

=== 0.3.0 (Sep 23, 2010)

* Proc#to_source & friends now work in IRB as well [#ngty]

=== 0.2.3 (Sep 15, 2010)

* since (static) code scanner doesn't run in 1.8.6, we enforce ParseTree mode
  for 1.8.6 [#ngty]

=== 0.2.2 (Sep 15, 2010)

* fixed failure to run on MRI-1.8.6 [#ngty]

=== 0.2.1 (Sep 14, 2010)

* introduced hack to ensure procs generated by Symbol#to_proc & Method#to_proc
  behaves exactly the same way under 1.8.*, 1.9.* & JRuby ~> always throwing
  CannotHandleCreatedOnTheFlyProcError [#ngty]
* minor cleaning up of ragel scanner [#ngty]

=== 0.2.0 (Sep 10, 2010)

* use home-baked ragel-based scanner for scanning for proc code [#ngty]
* renamed Sourcify::LexerInternalError to Sourcify::ParserInternalError since
  we are not using any lexer anymore [#ngty]
* introduces CannotParseEvalCodeError, CannotParseIrbCodeError &
  CannotHandleCreatedOnTheFlyProcError to handle procs that there is no way
  to extract code from [#ngty]
* tested against well known projects (eg. spree & redmine) to show that it is
  indeed working [#ngty]

=== 0.1.2 (Aug 30, 2010)

* introduced throwing of Sourcify::LexerInternalError when parser cannot handle
  incorrectly lexed code fragments [#ngty]
* fixed bug in lexing keyword literals (represented as Symbol) [#ngty]

=== 0.1.1 (Aug 30, 2010)

* fixed empty return for Proc#to_sexp after calling of Proc#to_source [#ngty]

=== 0.1.0 (Aug 28, 2010)

* 1st gem release !! [#ngty]
